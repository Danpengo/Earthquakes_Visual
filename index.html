      <h3>Countries and their disasters</h3>
      <p>Select a region in the bottom left to view that region more clearly.</p>
      <p>The map to the left establishes the death count per country from 1900-2020. This isn't divided by population as that is quite difficult to establish for earlier years, and isn't massively relevant for
          all types of disasters, for example wildfires are highly dependent on location rather than pure population. The map establishes a general sense of where disasters have struck the hardest without going into specifics,
          as that is what is explored in sections below</p>

      <h3>Deaths versus Disasters</h3>
      <p>Use the slider and selection boxes to manipulate the bar charts.</p>
      <p>The chart to the far right explores the total occurences of disaster by year for each region, providing insight into how many disasters occur yearly.</p>
      <p>Directly to the right we can see a presentation of deaths per disaster type, along with how many of that type of disaster has occured for the given continent.</p>

      <h3>Earthquakes</h3>
        <p> Use the selection box to zoom in on specific regions. </p>
      <p>The above map looks at extreme (>7 magnitude) earthquakes over the course of a century. There are some clear patterns we can observe, such as
      the many high magnitude earthquakes across South America and the scatter across pacific areas. We can also look at the types of earthquakes and we can look
      at some examples of rare earthquakes, for example the two 9 magnitude earthquakes in the North West USA in 1946 and 1964, both tsunami type earthquakes.</p>
      <p> The most important observation from this map is that the earthquakes unlike other disasters commonly occur in very specific places in the countries they're recorded in. In part this is due to
          the positioning of tectonic plates.</p>

      <h3>Amount of Disasters versus Type</h3>
        <p>Use the selection box to zoom in on specific locations for all the different types of disasters.</p>
        <p>The array of maps below show the distributions of 8 of the most common disasters versus where they occured, this tells several stories and allows us to distinguish the different
            locations for their primary disasters. For example storms, floods and earthquakes massively account for China's disasters, whereas for the United States we have wildfires, storms and floods accounting for a major portion of the total disasters.</p>
